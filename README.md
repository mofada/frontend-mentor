## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. I merged all the projects together, otherwise I would have to
create too many libraries. I think it looks better this way.

## Why I join the challenge

I joined the challenge to improve my skills and to learn new things. I also want to be able to work
on real projects and to be able to work with a team.

I'm learning tailwind css recently. I think it's a very good project. In the past, I preferred to
write CSS together. The first time I came into contact with tailwind css made me confused.

It was difficult for me to accept this writing method, but slowly I tried to accept it. I found
it was still very good. As everyone often says: question tailwind, understand tailwind, use
tailwind, become tailwind, surpass tailwind (what? I don't think I can surpass tailwind)
